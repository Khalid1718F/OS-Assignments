Design:

This program will be written in Java and will contain two seprate files.
Namely 'PidManager.java' (The main file) & 'PidManagerTest.java' (The test file)

In order to run this application you must use the test file (PidManagerTest.java).
The main method is contained in the test file in order to test the PidManager class.

The PidManager class has a substantial amount of documentation and can be seen there.
The PidManagerTest class calls the three methods that were part of the problem description.
One method to initiatlize the memory, a second to allocate the pid, and finally a third to release it.

The output of the program can be seen in the png file that is part of this directory.
