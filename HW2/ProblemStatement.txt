Assignment:

Write a multithreaded program that tests your solution to HW#1. 
You will create several threads – for example, 100 – and each thread will request a pid, 
sleep for a random period of time, and then release the pid. 
(Sleeping for a random period approximates the typical pid usage in which a pid is assigned to a new process, 
the process executes and terminates, and the pid is released on the process’ termination). 

On UNIX and Linux systems, sleeping is accomplished through the sleep() function, 
which is passed an integer value representing the number of seconds to sleep. 


Assumption:

This program involves multithreads and tests the solution to the problem in the first homework.
Several threads are created and each one requests a Pid from the manager. 
The Pid is then allowed to sleep for a certain amount of time and then released after a given duration.
When a pid is assigned to a new processthe typical amount of time taken for that is randomized.
Once the process executes and terminates the pid is released which what sleeping is.

This sleeping process can be done through a sleep() function on Linux and Unix systems.
The function is passed a value of type int to represent the number of sleep seconds.
